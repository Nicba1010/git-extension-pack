This is obviously satire but I'll probably end up using it

Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you; don't ask for it and you'll still get it because I have nothing better to do

## Commands

### git commit suicide

Exits your precious repository and destroys it (just the local copy).

### git commit jesus

Exits your repository, deletes all unpushed work (deletes the repo actually but the other thing sounds more complex), and clones it so you can screw it up again.
